# The JPG Trinity: JavaScript, Python & Go in the Real World

Learn JS, Python, and Go with examples, comparisons, problem-solving, and mini-projects.

---

## Overview

Welcome to **The JPG Trinity**, a curated learning path for **JavaScript, Python, and Go**.  
This repository is designed for self-taught developers, career switchers, or anyone from a **non-CS background** who wants to understand these three languages, how they compare, and how to use them in real-world projects.

Here you'll find:

- History and purpose of each language  
- What problems they solve and their limitations  
- Job market demand for each language  
- Comparison tables for syntax, runtime, and ecosystem  
- Example solutions to the same problem in all three languages  
- Dedicated folders to **learn, explore under-the-hood, solve problems, and practice mini-projects**

## History & Purpose

### JavaScript (JS)
- **Created:** 1995 by Brendan Eich  
- **Purpose:** Originally to make web pages interactive; now used for frontend, backend (Node.js), mobile, and even desktop apps.  
- **Strengths:** Full-stack web development, fast iteration, huge ecosystem (npm).  
- **Limitations:** Single-threaded, weak typing (unless using TypeScript), can be inconsistent across environments.

### Python
- **Created:** 1991 by Guido van Rossum  
- **Purpose:** General-purpose, beginner-friendly language; widely used in AI, data science, automation, scripting, and web development.  
- **Strengths:** Simple syntax, large standard library, excellent for AI/ML and automation.  
- **Limitations:** Slower runtime, less suitable for high-performance concurrent backend systems, dynamic typing can hide bugs.

### Go (Golang)
- **Created:** 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson at Google  
- **Purpose:** Build high-performance backend services and scalable cloud applications.  
- **Strengths:** Simple syntax, static typing, concurrency with goroutines, fast compilation, great tooling.  
- **Limitations:** Limited generics support (improving), smaller ecosystem compared to JS/Python, minimalistic standard library.
