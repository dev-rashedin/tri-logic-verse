## 📘 Logic Problem Set (Multi-Language Practice)

This problem set focuses on **pure programming logic**, not data structures or advanced algorithms.  
The goal is to strengthen **problem-solving, control flow, and reasoning skills** by solving the *same problems* in **multiple programming languages**.

### What this set emphasizes
- Conditional logic and edge-case handling  
- Loops, state transitions, and validation logic  
- Real-world inspired scenarios (e.g., systems, simulations, rules)  
- Language-agnostic thinking (logic first, syntax second)

### What this set avoids
- Data structures and algorithmic patterns (DSA)
- Library-heavy or shortcut-based solutions
- Language-specific tricks over clear logic

### Difficulty levels
- **Easy**: Fundamentals and foundational logic  
- **Intermediate**: Multi-step reasoning and constraints  
- **Hard**: State management, validations, and real-world logic

Solve each problem in **three different languages** to improve fluency, spot language differences, and build strong fundamentals that transfer across stacks.
